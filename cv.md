## English

One day I thought that knowledge of english is very important for me. And started to learn it daily by myself at home.
First steps I did watching english courses, after that reading Murphy's books. When I understood that collecting
information was enough for conversation I tried to chat and visit some places in my city to hang out with natives.
Also I started to travel more using couchsurfing and made friends I have a contact with to this day.
